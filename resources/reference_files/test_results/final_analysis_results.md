  "report_title": "Hydraulic Valve Control System with Partial Stroke Test Capability",
  "executive_summary": "This document outlines a hydraulic control system designed for an unclassified control valve, incorporating a Partial Stroke Test Device for enhanced reliability and safety. The system integrates various field-mounted and shared display/control switches, along with position feedback, to manage valve operation and diagnostic functions.",
  "system_workflow_narrative": "The process begins with the Hydraulic Supply, which provides motive power to the system. This supply is routed through the Partial Stroke Test Device, tagged as PSTD NOTE-1, before reaching the Unclassified Control Valve, XV XXXX. The PSTD NOTE-1 is integral to the hydraulic path, suggesting it either conditions the hydraulic fluid or acts as an intermediary control element for the main valve. Following the control valve, the hydraulic fluid is directed to the Hydraulic Return line, completing the circuit. The Solenoid Actuator, S, is directly coupled to the XV XXXX valve, indicating it is responsible for modulating the valve's position.",
  "control_logic_analysis": "The control strategy for this system is distributed, involving multiple hand switches and logic functions. A central logic function, I, receives input signals from shared display/control hand switches HS XXXX B and HS XXXX E. This logic function then transmits signals to field-mounted hand switches HS XXXX A and HS XXXX B, as well as to the shared display/control position indicator ZL XXXX. The ZL XXXX indicator also receives direct feedback from field-mounted position switches ZSL XXXX (low) and ZSH XXXX (high), providing real-time valve position status. The Partial Stroke Test Device, PSTD NOTE-1, is a critical element, receiving input signals from an unclassified position alarm XZA XXXX, an unclassified hand switch XHS XXXX, an unclassified position indicator XZI XXXX, and a field-mounted relay/compute/convert unit XY XXXX B. The PSTD NOTE-1 then sends a control signal to the Solenoid Actuator, S. Additionally, another field-mounted relay/compute/convert unit, XY XXXX, directly signals the Solenoid Actuator, S, which in turn actuates the Unclassified Control Valve, XV XXXX. This layered control suggests a robust system for both operational control and diagnostic testing of the valve.",
