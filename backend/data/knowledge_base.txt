## SECTION 0: QUICK REFERENCE - COMMON CALCULATIONS

### 0.1 Manual J Load Calculations (Climate Zone 7)
- Heating Load Formula: BTU/h = Area (ft²) × U-Value × ΔT (87°F)
- Cooling Load Formula: BTU/h = Area (ft²) × U-Value × ΔT (19°F) + Internal Gains
  * Internal Gains = People (250 BTU/person) + Lights (3.4 BTU/W) + Appliances (varies)
  * Typical Residential: 1,200-2,400 BTU/h total internal gains
- Basement Correction: Multiply wall load by 0.85 (below-grade thermal mass)

## SECTION 6: TROUBLESHOOTING DECISION TREES

### 6.1 Oversizing Diagnosis (Equipment Selection Issues)
SYMPTOM: Heating capacity exceeds load by > 40%
ROOT CAUSES:
1. Conservative multipliers applied without justification
2. Load calculation used high-side assumptions for all components
3. Added "safety factor" on top of design load
4. Equipment selected from next size up without interpolation
REMEDIATION: Recalculate using actual blueprint dimensions, use MN Code default U-values

SYMPTOM: Short cycling (equipment runs < 10 minutes per cycle)
ROOT CAUSES:
1. Oversized heating equipment (> 40% oversize)
2. Oversized cooling equipment (> 15% oversize)
3. Thermostat differential too narrow (< 1°F)
REMEDIATION: Right-size equipment to MN Rule 1322.0403 limits

### 6.2 Duct System Issues
SYMPTOM: High static pressure (> 0.5" WC external)
ROOT CAUSES:
1. Undersized return air duct (< 300 CFM per ton)
2. Too many elbows (> 4 per run without transitions)
3. Incorrect duct sizing (velocity > 900 FPM residential)
REMEDIATION: Verify return air = 1.2× supply area, limit velocity to 700-900 FPM

SYMPTOM: Uneven heating/cooling between rooms
ROOT CAUSES:
1. Supply duct imbalance (no balancing dampers)
2. Return air inadequate (door undercuts < 1")
3. Excessive duct leakage (> 10% of airflow)
REMEDIATION: Install balancing dampers, add transfer grilles, seal duct joints

### 6.3 Control System Diagnostics
OPEN LOOP FAULT: Valve without sensor/controller
- Search for orphaned TV, CV without matching TT/TE upstream
- Verify control signal path: TE → TC → TV complete

ORPHANED SENSOR: Sensor without output destination
- Check for TT, TE with no signal line to controller
- Common on abandoned analog points converted to BAS

FAIL-SAFE VALIDATION:
- Heating coil valve: Should be Fail-OPEN (FO) for freeze protection
- Cooling coil valve: Should be Fail-CLOSED (FC) to prevent flooding
- OA damper: Should be Fail-CLOSED (FC) for fire safety
- Exhaust damper: Should be Fail-OPEN (FO) for smoke evacuation

### 7.4 Combustion Air Requirements (MN Mechanical Code)
RULE: 50 CFM per 1000 BTU/h input for natural draft appliances
CALCULATION:
- 100,000 BTU/h furnace needs 5,000 CFM combustion air volume
- Two permanent openings: 1 sq in per 1000 BTU/h (each opening)
COMMON ERROR: Single opening or inadequate sizing (starved combustion = CO risk)

### 7.5 Freeze Protection (MN Climate Zone 7)
MANDATORY for all hydronic coils:
- Freeze stat (TSL) set at 35°F on leaving air
- Hardwired to shut down supply fan (not BAS-only)
- Proof of flow interlock on pumped coils
WHY CRITICAL: -17°F design temp means unprotected coils freeze in hours during fan failure

## SECTION 8: ASHRAE STANDARD 62.1 - VENTILATION

### 8.1 Outdoor Air Requirements
RESIDENTIAL (ASHRAE 62.2):
- Formula: CFM = 0.01 × Floor Area + 7.5 × (Bedrooms + 1)

## SECTION 11: EQUIPMENT TYPE RECOGNITION & CLASSIFICATION

### 11.1 Equipment Configuration Types
**Package Unit (Single Cabinet)**
- All components in one cabinet: furnace/heat exchanger, evaporator coil, condenser, compressor
- Common: Rooftop Units (RTU) for commercial, ground-mounted package units for residential
- Advantages: Factory assembled, tested; single point of service
- Disadvantages: All-or-nothing replacement, limited flexibility

**Split System (Two Components)**
- Indoor unit: Furnace or Air Handler with evaporator coil
- Outdoor unit: Condenser/compressor (AC) or heat pump outdoor unit
- Most common residential configuration
- Advantages: Indoor/outdoor separation, flexible installation
- Refrigerant lines connect indoor and outdoor units

**Mini-Split (Ductless Split)**
- Wall-mounted or ceiling cassette indoor head(s)
- Outdoor condenser/compressor
- No ductwork required (ductless) or small distribution ducts
- Common for additions, retrofits, or zoning applications
- Multi-zone capability: one outdoor unit, multiple indoor heads

### 11.2 Equipment Stage Control Recognition
**Single-Stage (ON/OFF)**
- Simple thermostat control: 100% on or 0% off
- Short cycling common if oversized
- Subject to 40% oversize limit (MN Rule 1322.0403)
- Lowest cost, basic comfort

**Two-Stage (Low/High)**
- Low fire (typically 60-70% capacity) for mild conditions
- High fire (100%) for extreme conditions
- Better comfort than single-stage
- Exempt from strict 40% limit per MN code exception
- Moderate cost premium

**Modulating (Variable Capacity)**
- Continuous capacity adjustment: 40-100% typical range
- Best comfort and efficiency
- NO oversize limit per MN Rule 1322.0403 exception
- Highest cost, best performance
- Common terms: "variable capacity," "communicating," "inverter"

**Variable-Speed (Fan Control)**
- May apply to fan motor or compressor
- Variable-speed blower: better airflow control, quieter
- Variable-speed compressor: capacity modulation like modulating furnace
- Often combined with modulating/two-stage for full system control

### 11.3 Equipment Capacity Staging Recognition
Look for these indicators in specifications:
- "Single-stage" or "ON/OFF" → Single-stage
- "Two-stage," "Low/High fire," "Dual fuel" → Two-stage
- "Modulating," "Variable capacity," "Inverter," "Communicating" → Modulating
- "ECM," "Variable-speed blower," "VSP" → Variable-speed fan
- Capacity range (e.g., "40-100%") → Modulating

## SECTION 12: LOAD CALCULATION METHODOLOGY (DETAILED MANUAL J)

### 12.1 Heating Load Components (Climate Zone 7)
**Envelope Losses (Conduction)**
- Formula: BTU/h = Area (sqft) × U-value × ΔT
- ΔT = Indoor temp (70°F) - Outdoor design temp (-17°F) = 87°F
- Calculate separately: Walls, Windows, Doors, Ceiling, Floor/Basement

**Below-Grade Correction (Basements)**
- Basement walls lose less heat due to ground temperature moderation
- Apply 0.85 correction factor to basement wall loads
- Full-height basement: walls only, not floor (floor on earth = minimal loss)
- Walkout basement: above-grade portion = full load, below-grade = 0.85 factor

**Infiltration/Air Leakage**
- Formula: BTU/h = Volume (cuft) × ACH × 0.018 × ΔT
- ACH (Air Changes per Hour): 0.35 typical, 0.25 tight construction, 0.50 leaky
- Sensible load only for heating (no latent component in winter)
- Can be reduced if mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (HRV/ERV)

**Duct Losses (if in unconditioned space)**
- Uninsulated ducts in attic/crawlspace: 25-40% heat loss typical
- Insulated ducts (R-6 to R-8): 10-15% loss
- Formula: Duct loss = Total load × Loss factor
- Best practice: Locate ducts within conditioned space

### 12.2 Cooling Load Components (Climate Zone 7)
**Envelope Gains (Conduction)**
- Formula: BTU/h = Area (sqft) × U-value × ΔT
- ΔT = Outdoor design temp (89°F) - Indoor temp (75°F) = 14-19°F (varies by component)
- Smaller than heating ΔT, so envelope is less dominant in cooling

**Solar Heat Gain (Windows)**
- Formula: BTU/h = Area (sqft) × Solar Intensity × SHGC × CLF
- Solar Intensity varies by orientation (see table in Section 0)
- SHGC (Solar Heat Gain Coefficient): 0.25-0.40 typical for double-pane
- CLF (Cooling Load Factor): 0.60-0.80 accounts for thermal mass and time lag
- Critical for west and southwest-facing windows

**Internal Gains (Occupants, Lights, Appliances)**
- People: 250 BTU/person sensible + 200 BTU/person latent = 450 total
- Lighting: 3.4 BTU/h per Watt (all sensible)
- Appliances: Refrigerator 1500 BTU/h, Range 2000 BTU/h (cooking), etc.
- Electronics: Computer 400 BTU/h, TV 200-400 BTU/h
- Typical residential: 1,200-2,400 BTU/h total internal gains

**Infiltration/Ventilation (Sensible + Latent)**
- Sensible: CFM × 1.08 × ΔT (temperature difference)
- Latent: CFM × 0.68 × Δω (humidity ratio difference)
- Climate Zone 7: Outdoor design 89°F / 50% RH, Indoor 75°F / 50% RH
- Latent load is smaller in Minnesota than humid climates
- ASHRAE 62.2 ventilation adds to cooling load (outdoor air is warm)

**Duct Gains (if in unconditioned space)**
- Hot attic: ducts gain heat from surroundings
- Typical gain: 15-30% of sensible load if in attic
- Solution: Insulate ducts (R-8 minimum) or locate in conditioned space

### 12.3 Sensible vs Latent Cooling Loads
**Sensible Load** (changes temperature, no phase change)
- Conduction through envelope
- Solar radiation through windows
- Internal gains (people sensible, lights, appliances)
- Infiltration/ventilation sensible

**Latent Load** (changes humidity, phase change - water vapor)
- Occupants perspiration and respiration
- Infiltration/ventilation (outdoor humidity)
- Cooking, bathing, plants
- No latent load from conduction or solar (those are sensible only)

**Total Cooling Load = Sensible + Latent**
- Minnesota typical: 70-80% sensible, 20-30% latent
- Humid climates: 50-60% sensible, 40-50% latent
- Sensible/Latent ratio affects equipment selection

## SECTION 13: VENTILATION REQUIREMENTS (ASHRAE 62.2)

### 13.1 Residential Ventilation Formula
**ASHRAE 62.2 Requirement**
- Formula: CFM = 0.03 × Floor Area (sqft) + 7.5 × (Bedrooms + 1)
- Example: 2000 sqft, 3 bedrooms → 0.03×2000 + 7.5×4 = 60 + 30 = 90 CFM
- This is continuous ventilation rate (24/7 operation)

**Intermittent Ventilation Credit**
- If ventilation system runs part-time (e.g., when HVAC operates)
- Must provide higher CFM when running to achieve time-averaged requirement
- Formula: CFM_intermittent = CFM_continuous × (60 min / Runtime minutes per hour)

**Infiltration Credit**
- Natural air leakage can reduce mechanical ventilation requirement
- Must measure with blower door test (ACH50)
- Credit = Infiltration CFM × 0.5 (50% credit per ASHRAE)
- Net mechanical ventilation = Required - Infiltration Credit

### 13.2 Ventilation Equipment Options
**Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV)**
- Transfers heat AND moisture between exhaust and outdoor air
- Best for Climate Zone 7: recovers heat in winter, pre-conditions outdoor air in summer
- Typical efficiency: 60-80% sensible recovery, 40-60% latent recovery
- Reduces heating/cooling load from ventilation by 60-80%

**Heat Recovery Ventilator (HRV)**
- Transfers heat only (no moisture transfer)
- Good for winter heat recovery, less benefit in summer
- Typical efficiency: 60-85% heat recovery
- Simpler than ERV, lower cost

**Fresh Air Duct to Return Plenum**
- Simplest method: duct from outdoors to return air plenum
- Manual or motorized damper controls airflow
- No energy recovery (full ventilation load on HVAC system)
- Only acceptable if natural infiltration provides most of requirement

**Exhaust-Only Ventilation**
- Continuous bathroom/kitchen exhaust fan
- Makeup air infiltrates through building envelope
- Not energy efficient (unconditioned makeup air)
- May create negative pressure issues

### 13.3 Ventilation Load Impact
- Climate Zone 7: Outdoor air is much colder (winter) or warmer (summer) than indoor
- Winter: 90 CFM at -17°F → ≈8,000 BTU/h heating load (no ERV)
- Winter with 70% ERV: ≈2,400 BTU/h heating load (70% recovery)
- Summer: 90 CFM at 89°F → ≈1,400 BTU/h sensible + latent (no ERV)
- ERV significantly reduces ventilation energy penalty

## SECTION 14: ECONOMIZER REQUIREMENTS & OPERATION

### 14.1 Code Requirements (ASHRAE 90.1 / MN Energy Code)
**When Required**
- Climate Zone 7 (Minnesota): Economizer required if cooling capacity > 54,000 BTU/h (4.5 tons)
- Applies to packaged units, rooftop units, split systems over threshold
- Exception: Systems with energy recovery (ERV) may be exempt

**Economizer Purpose**
- Provides "free cooling" when outdoor air is cool/dry enough
- Reduces or eliminates mechanical cooling during favorable outdoor conditions
- Can meet 100% cooling load with outdoor air when conditions right

### 14.2 Economizer Control Types
**Differential Dry-Bulb**
- Compares outdoor temperature to return air temperature
- Enables economizer when OAT < RAT (outdoor cooler than return)
- Simplest control, least expensive
- Works well in dry climates, acceptable for Climate Zone 7

**Differential Enthalpy**
- Compares outdoor enthalpy (temp + humidity) to return air enthalpy
- More sophisticated than dry-bulb: accounts for humidity
- Better efficiency in humid conditions
- Requires enthalpy sensors (temp + humidity)
- Recommended for Climate Zone 7 for best performance

**Fixed Dry-Bulb**
- Economizer enabled when OAT < 55°F (or other fixed setpoint)
- Simple control, no return air sensor needed
- Less efficient than differential methods
- Rarely used in modern systems

### 14.3 Economizer Components
**Motorized Outdoor Air Damper**
- Modulates from minimum position to 100% open
- Must be able to provide 100% outdoor air for economizer mode
- Typical: 10-20% minimum position for ventilation, 100% for economizer

**Return Air Damper**
- Modulates opposite to outdoor air damper
- Closes as OA damper opens (maintains constant airflow)
- Prevents over-pressurization when economizer operating

**Mixed Air Temperature Sensor**
- Monitors temperature after outdoor and return air mix
- Used for control: modulate dampers to achieve cooling setpoint
- Freeze protection: prevent coil freezing from cold outdoor air

**Control Sequence**
- Stage 1: Modulate economizer dampers (free cooling)
- Stage 2: If economizer insufficient, enable mechanical cooling
- Stage 3: Full mechanical cooling if outdoor air unfavorable

## SECTION 15: COMBUSTION AIR REQUIREMENTS

### 15.1 Natural Gas Furnace Combustion Air
**Standard Atmospheric Furnace (80% AFUE)**
- Requires combustion air from space where located
- Rule of thumb: 50 CFM per 100,000 BTU/h input
- For 80,000 BTU/h furnace: 40 CFM combustion air
- Must have adequate air supply: outdoor air duct or large openings to outside

**Condensing Furnace (90%+ AFUE)**
- Sealed combustion: outdoor air piped directly to burner
- Does not use indoor air for combustion
- PVC vent pipe (low temp exhaust)
- No combustion air opening required in mechanical room

**Direct Vent**
- Sealed combustion with coaxial pipe (exhaust inside, intake outside)
- Most efficient air usage
- Can be installed in tight spaces without ventilation concerns

### 15.2 Makeup Air for Exhaust Systems
**Kitchen Exhaust (Commercial)**
- Kitchen hoods > 400 CFM require makeup air
- Makeup air = 50-80% of exhaust CFM (code varies)
- Makeup air should be tempered (heated) in winter
- Prevents negative pressure that affects HVAC and combustion

**Residential Kitchen/Bath Exhaust**
- Typically < 400 CFM, no specific makeup air requirement
- Natural infiltration provides makeup air
- Can create slight negative pressure (watch for backdrafting)

### 15.3 Combustion Safety
**Backdrafting Risk**
- Negative pressure can prevent proper venting of combustion gases
- Risk: CO (carbon monoxide) spillage into building
- Prevention: adequate combustion air, proper venting, sealed combustion
- Test: CAZ (Combustion Appliance Zone) depressurization test

**Carbon Monoxide Detection**
- Required by code in residential with fuel-burning appliances
- CO alarms near sleeping areas and mechanical room
- Professional combustion safety testing recommended

## SECTION 16: DUCT SYSTEM DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### 16.1 Duct Sizing Methods
**Equal Friction Method**
- Maintain constant friction rate (pressure drop per 100 ft) throughout system
- Typical: 0.08-0.10 in. WC per 100 ft for residential
- Duct sizes decrease as branches split off
- Results in balanced system with even airflow distribution

**Velocity Method**
- Size ducts to maintain target velocity
- Residential supply trunk: 700-900 FPM
- Residential branch: 500-700 FPM
- Residential return: 500-700 FPM
- Lower velocity = quieter, but larger ducts

**Static Regain Method**
- Used for long duct runs in commercial applications
- Velocity decreases downstream to regain static pressure
- Maintains constant total pressure at each outlet
- More complex calculation, rarely used in residential

### 16.2 Duct Velocity Limits (Noise Control)
- **Main Supply Trunk**: 700-900 FPM residential, up to 1200 FPM commercial
- **Branch Supplies**: 500-700 FPM residential, 800-1000 FPM commercial
- **Return Ducts**: 500-700 FPM residential, 800-1000 FPM commercial
- Exceeding limits causes: noise, whistling, pressure drop, inefficiency

### 16.3 Duct Insulation Requirements
**Unconditioned Space (Attic, Crawlspace, Garage)**
- Supply ducts: R-8 minimum per IECC/ASHRAE 90.1
- Return ducts: R-6 minimum (less critical than supply)
- Prevents: heat loss/gain, condensation (cooling mode)

**Conditioned Space**
- No insulation required for thermal purposes
- May insulate return for sound attenuation
- Best practice: locate all ducts in conditioned space (no losses)

**Duct Sealing**
- Seal all joints and seams with mastic or metal tape
- Typical leakage: 25-40% in older systems (huge efficiency loss)
- Target leakage: < 5% for new construction
- Test: Duct blaster test measures leakage CFM25

### 16.4 Static Pressure Budget
**Residential System Total External Static Pressure**
- Target: ≤ 0.5 in. WC total ESP
- Components: supply duct, return duct, filter, coil
- Exceeding budget: reduced airflow, higher energy, shortened equipment life

**Commercial System**
- Typical: 1.0-2.5 in. WC depending on duct length and system complexity
- Fan selection must match pressure requirement
- Higher pressure = more fan energy (HP)

## SECTION 17: EQUIPMENT EFFICIENCY STANDARDS & RATINGS

### 17.1 Heating Efficiency Metrics
**AFUE (Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency)**
- Applies to: Gas/oil furnaces, boilers
- Definition: % of fuel energy converted to useful heat (annual average)
- Federal minimum: 80% AFUE (atmospheric), 95% AFUE (condensing, northern states)
- Minnesota: 95% AFUE minimum for Climate Zone 7
- Example: 80% furnace wastes 20% up chimney, 95% wastes only 5%

**HSPF (Heating Season Performance Factor)**
- Applies to: Heat pumps, electric heating
- Definition: BTU heat output per Watt-hour electricity (seasonal average)
- Federal minimum: 8.2 HSPF (northern regions)
- Higher is better: 10+ HSPF is high efficiency
- HSPF2 is newer test standard (2023+), typically 15% lower numbers than HSPF

### 17.2 Cooling Efficiency Metrics
**SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio)**
- Applies to: Air conditioners, heat pumps (cooling mode)
- Definition: BTU cooling per Watt-hour electricity (seasonal average)
- Federal minimum: 14 SEER (northern regions), 15 SEER (southern)
- Higher is better: 16-20+ SEER is high efficiency
- SEER2 is newer standard (2023+), typically ~5% lower than SEER

**EER (Energy Efficiency Ratio)**
- Instantaneous efficiency at specific conditions (95°F outdoor)
- Used for: Commercial equipment, supplementary rating
- Definition: BTU cooling per Watt-hour at rated condition
- Typically lower than SEER (no seasonal averaging benefit)

### 17.3 Efficiency Impact on Operating Cost
- Climate Zone 7: Heating season dominates (cold climate)
- Upgrading 80% AFUE to 96% AFUE: ~17% energy savings (heating)
- Upgrading 14 SEER to 18 SEER: ~22% energy savings (cooling, but less total impact)
- Payback period: Calculate based on fuel cost, climate, usage
