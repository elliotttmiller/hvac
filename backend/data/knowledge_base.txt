## SECTION 0: QUICK REFERENCE - COMMON CALCULATIONS

### 0.1 Manual J Load Calculations (Climate Zone 7)
- Heating Load Formula: BTU/h = Area (ft²) × U-Value × ΔT (87°F)
- Cooling Load Formula: BTU/h = Area (ft²) × U-Value × ΔT (19°F) + Internal Gains
- Basement Correction: Multiply wall load by 0.85 (below-grade thermal mass)

### 0.2 Minnesota Code U-Value Maximums (Worst Case Assumptions)
- Windows: U=0.32 (double-pane low-e), U=0.48 (single-pane)
- Walls: U=0.060 (R-20 minimum for Zone 7)
- Roof/Ceiling: U=0.026 (R-49 minimum)
- Basement Walls: U=0.050 (R-15 minimum)

## SECTION 1: THE ISA-5.1 DECODING MATRIX (STRICT)

### 1.1 The Parsing Rule (The "5-Column Logic")
To decode a tag (e.g., "PDIC"), analyze letters sequentially. 
CRITICAL RULE: Check Column 2 (Modifiers) immediately after the 1st letter.
- Example: PDT = Pressure (Col 1) + Differential (Col 2) + Transmitter (Col 4).
- Example: LAH = Level (Col 1) + Alarm (Col 3) + High (Col 5).

## SECTION 6: TROUBLESHOOTING DECISION TREES

### 6.1 Oversizing Diagnosis (Equipment Selection Issues)
SYMPTOM: Heating capacity exceeds load by > 40%
ROOT CAUSES:
1. Conservative multipliers applied without justification
2. Load calculation used high-side assumptions for all components
3. Added "safety factor" on top of design load
4. Equipment selected from next size up without interpolation
REMEDIATION: Recalculate using actual blueprint dimensions, use MN Code default U-values

SYMPTOM: Short cycling (equipment runs < 10 minutes per cycle)
ROOT CAUSES:
1. Oversized heating equipment (> 40% oversize)
2. Oversized cooling equipment (> 15% oversize)
3. Thermostat differential too narrow (< 1°F)
REMEDIATION: Right-size equipment to MN Rule 1322.0403 limits

### 6.2 Duct System Issues
SYMPTOM: High static pressure (> 0.5" WC external)
ROOT CAUSES:
1. Undersized return air duct (< 300 CFM per ton)
2. Too many elbows (> 4 per run without transitions)
3. Incorrect duct sizing (velocity > 900 FPM residential)
REMEDIATION: Verify return air = 1.2× supply area, limit velocity to 700-900 FPM

SYMPTOM: Uneven heating/cooling between rooms
ROOT CAUSES:
1. Supply duct imbalance (no balancing dampers)
2. Return air inadequate (door undercuts < 1")
3. Excessive duct leakage (> 10% of airflow)
REMEDIATION: Install balancing dampers, add transfer grilles, seal duct joints

### 6.3 Control System Diagnostics
OPEN LOOP FAULT: Valve without sensor/controller
- Search for orphaned TV, CV without matching TT/TE upstream
- Verify control signal path: TE → TC → TV complete

ORPHANED SENSOR: Sensor without output destination
- Check for TT, TE with no signal line to controller
- Common on abandoned analog points converted to BAS

FAIL-SAFE VALIDATION:
- Heating coil valve: Should be Fail-OPEN (FO) for freeze protection
- Cooling coil valve: Should be Fail-CLOSED (FC) to prevent flooding
- OA damper: Should be Fail-CLOSED (FC) for fire safety
- Exhaust damper: Should be Fail-OPEN (FO) for smoke evacuation

## SECTION 7: MINNESOTA-SPECIFIC CODE REQUIREMENTS

### 7.1 MN Rule 1322.0403 - Equipment Sizing (Heating)
TEXT: "Heating equipment capacity shall not exceed the design heating load by more than 40%"
APPLICATION: 
- Furnaces, boilers, heat pumps (heating mode)
- Calculated at AHRI design conditions (-17°F outdoor)
- Exception: Two-stage or modulating equipment (no limit)
ENFORCEMENT: Plan review rejection if > 40% oversize without justification

### 7.2 MN Rule 1322.0404 - Equipment Sizing (Cooling)
TEXT: "Cooling equipment capacity shall not exceed the design cooling load by more than 15%"
APPLICATION:
- Air conditioners, heat pumps (cooling mode)
- Calculated at AHRI design conditions (89°F outdoor, 75°F indoor)
ENFORCEMENT: Common violation, often missed by contractors

### 7.3 MN Energy Code 1322.0700 - Duct Insulation
REQUIREMENT:
- Supply ducts in unconditioned spaces: R-8 minimum
- Return ducts in unconditioned spaces: R-6 minimum
- Exception: Ducts within conditioned space (no insulation required)
COMMON VIOLATIONS:
- Attic ductwork with inadequate insulation (R-4.2 flex duct common but non-compliant)
- Basement return ducts uninsulated (required if basement unconditioned)

### 7.4 Combustion Air Requirements (MN Mechanical Code)
RULE: 50 CFM per 1000 BTU/h input for natural draft appliances
CALCULATION:
- 100,000 BTU/h furnace needs 5,000 CFM combustion air volume
- Two permanent openings: 1 sq in per 1000 BTU/h (each opening)
COMMON ERROR: Single opening or inadequate sizing (starved combustion = CO risk)

### 7.5 Freeze Protection (MN Climate Zone 7)
MANDATORY for all hydronic coils:
- Freeze stat (TSL) set at 35°F on leaving air
- Hardwired to shut down supply fan (not BAS-only)
- Proof of flow interlock on pumped coils
WHY CRITICAL: -17°F design temp means unprotected coils freeze in hours during fan failure

## SECTION 8: ASHRAE STANDARD 62.1 - VENTILATION

### 8.1 Outdoor Air Requirements
RESIDENTIAL (ASHRAE 62.2):
- Formula: CFM = 0.01 × Floor Area + 7.5 × (Bedrooms + 1)
- Example: 2000 ft², 3 BR = 0.01(2000) + 7.5(4) = 50 CFM minimum

COMMERCIAL (ASHRAE 62.1):
- Office: 5 CFM/person + 0.06 CFM/ft²
- Classroom: 10 CFM/person + 0.12 CFM/ft²
- Retail: 7.5 CFM/person + 0.06 CFM/ft²

### 8.2 Economizer Requirements (MN Energy Code)
WHEN REQUIRED: Cooling systems > 54,000 BTU/h (4.5 tons)
TYPE: Differential dry-bulb economizer (compare OAT vs. RAT)
CONTROL: Dampers modulate to provide free cooling when OAT < 55°F
EXCEPTION: High humidity spaces (natatoriums, kitchens)

OVERSIZING CONSEQUENCE: 
- Poor dehumidification (< 10 min runtime)
- Higher energy cost (inefficient cycling)
- Reduced equipment life (mechanical stress)

### 9.3 Heat Pump Selection (Cold Climate)
MINIMUM HSPF: 8.2 (Zone 7)
COLD CLIMATE MODELS: Rated to -15°F or colder
BACKUP HEAT: Required below balance point (typically -5°F to +15°F)
DEFROST STRATEGY: Demand defrost preferred over timed

### 9.4 Duct Materials
SHEET METAL: Preferred for longevity, low leakage, fire rating
FLEX DUCT: Acceptable for branch runs, limit to 10 ft per run
DUCT BOARD: Acceptable for commercial, NOT recommended for residential (MN humidity)
SEALING: Mastic required on all joints (tape not code-compliant for pressure class)
